# Deep Learning Framework

This is a commonly used deep learning framework (or maybe template? ).

My purpose in creating this repo is to enable better and faster initiation of deep learning tasks based on PyTorch. 

# Getting Started

Basically, just run this command first: 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Then, modify the details of the code. 

Finally, start training by running `python train.py`.  

Also, some commonly used model architectures (such as U-Net, ResNet) are already prepared in `components.py`, and is still being updated.
